            I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications using the MERN stack. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how things work on the web, which quickly grew into a strong interest in building full-stack applications. I'm confident in frontend development and currently expanding my skills in backend with tools like Express.js and MongoDB. I enjoy solving real-world problems, creating clean UIs, and learning new technologies. Outside of coding, I love watching football, anime, and exploring tech through docs and AI tools.
